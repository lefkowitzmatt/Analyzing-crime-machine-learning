# ml-clustering-lowering-crime
This project is a python based project where St. Louis neighborhoods were clustered based on crime type and venue type to examine the impact of businesses on crime. 

The packages used to complete the project were mainly numpy, pandas, and sklearn. In sklearn, the clustering function for Kmeans was used.

Results indicated that crime type did vary depending on the nearby business. More reasearch is needed to determine the full association between different crime types and business types to be able to match certain crimes with certain business. St. Louis was chosen for its publishing of public data and due to its severe crime problem; St. Louis currently has the highest crime rate in the U.S.
